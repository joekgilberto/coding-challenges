# Coding Challenges

Hello!  This is a repository to keep track of my coding challenges (typically sourced from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/)).

Each file, when ran, will print out:
- The title of the challenge.
- A description of the challenge.
- The constraints of the challenge.
- And a few inputed use cases and their output.

For further information on how the problem was solved, please consult the file itself for the solution.

Typically I solve my coding challenges with Python.  To run any of these challeneges on a MacOS with a silicon M1 chip follow the instruction below:

1. Clone this repository from GitHub.
2. If need be download the appropriate [Python package](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for your system.
3. Using your Terminal, navigate into the proper directory.
4. Create a virtual environment using the following command:

```
python3 -m venv myenv
```

5. Activate your virtual environemnt using the following command:

```
source myenv/bin/activate
```

6. Run the file of your choosing using the following command template:

```
python3 <file name>.py
```

7. Read the output in your terminal.
